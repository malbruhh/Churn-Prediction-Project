# Iranian Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Network to predict customer churn using the **Iranian Churn Dataset**. It explores different model architectures, optimizers, and loss functions to identify the most effective configuration for binary classification.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict whether a customer will churn based on 12 features, including call failure, usage frequency, and customer value. The project compares three different Neural Network configurations:
1.  **Model 1:** Adam Optimizer + Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss.
2.  **Model 2:** SGD Optimizer + Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss.
3.  **Model 3:** Adam Optimizer + MSE Loss + Extra Hidden Layer (16 neurons → 8 neurons).

## Data Preprocessing
[cite_start]The script performs a rigorous preprocessing pipeline to ensure data quality:
* [cite_start]**Cleaning:** Column names are standardized to lowercase and underscores.
* [cite_start]**Deduplication:** Exact duplicate rows are removed to prevent bias.
* [cite_start]**Feature Engineering:** One-hot encoding is applied to categorical features (`complains`, `tariff_plan`, `status`), and redundant columns like `age_group` are dropped.
* [cite_start]**Outlier Treatment:** Applied **Log Transformation** (`np.log1p`) to highly skewed usage data (e.g., `seconds_of_use`, `frequency_of_sms`) to normalize distributions.
* [cite_start]**Scaling:** Used **Min-Max Scaling** to bring all features into a uniform range of [0, 1][cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Splitting:** A stratified 80/20 split is used to maintain the class ratio in both training and testing sets.

## Model Architectures
[cite_start]All models utilize **ReLU** activation for hidden layers and **Sigmoid** for the output layer to provide probability-based predictions.

| Feature | Model 1 | Model 2 | Model 3 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Hidden Layers** | 1 (8 neurons) | 1 (8 neurons) | 2 (16 → 8 neurons) |
| **Activation** | ReLU | ReLU | ReLU |
| **Optimizer** | Adam | SGD | Adam |
| **Loss Function** | MSE | Binary Cross-Entropy | MSE |
| **Epochs** | 500 | 500 | 500 |

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <your-repo-folder>
2. **Install requirements:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
3. **Run Project**:
    ```bash
    python main.py

## Visualizations
[cite_start]The project generates three key plots for each model to evaluate performance:
* [cite_start]**Loss Curve:** Tracks Training vs. Validation loss over epochs to detect overfitting.
* [cite_start]**Accuracy Graph:** Visualizes how the success rate improves over time
* [cite_start]**Confusion Matrix:** Provides a heatmap of True Positives, False Positives, True Negatives, and False Negatives to assess business impact.
